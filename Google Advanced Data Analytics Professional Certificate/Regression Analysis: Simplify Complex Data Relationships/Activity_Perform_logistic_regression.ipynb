        "In this activity, you will complete an effective bionomial logistic regression. This exercise will help you better understand the value of using logistic regression to make predictions for a dependent variable based on one independent variable and help you build confidence in practicing logistic regression. Because logistic regression is leveraged across a wide array of industries, becoming proficient in this process will help you expand your skill set in a widely-applicable way.   \n",
        "\n",
        "For this activity, you work as a consultant for an airline. The airline is interested in knowing if a better in-flight entertainment experience leads to higher customer satisfaction. They would like you to construct and evaluate a model that predicts whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data for this activity is for a sample size of 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. Your goal will be to utilize a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline model and better understand this data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because this activity uses a dataset from the industry, you will need to conduct basic EDA, data cleaning, and other manipulations to prepare the data for modeling.\n",
